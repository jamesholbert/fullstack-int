This is my Full Stack Interview App Project

To run the app locally:

1 first clone the repo

2 create a python virtualenv targeting the 'fullstack-int' dir

3 cd to fullstack-int where requirements.txt is located

4 activate your virtualenv with 'source bin/activate'

5 run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your shell.

6 from the 'src' directory, run 'npm install'

7 from the 'src' directory, run 'gulp'

8 navigate in your browser to localhost:5000

Hope you like it!
