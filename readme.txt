This is my Full Stack Interview App Project

Time frame (all Wednesday, October 25th)
8:35-10:05am
10:30-12:40pm
2:05-5:05pm
8:15-9:35pm

To run the app locally:

1 first clone the repo

2 create a python virtualenv targeting the fullstack-int dir (you need to pip install virtualenv first) by typing 'virtualenv fullstack-int' from the parent dir

3 cd to fullstack-int where requirements.txt is located

4 activate your virtualenv with 'source bin/activate', this will emulate the virtual environment

5 run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your shell.

6 from the 'src' directory, run 'npm install'

7 from the 'src' directory, run 'gulp'

8 navigate in your browser to localhost:5000

Hope you like it!
